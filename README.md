# wrenchdb
## Project Description
Wrenchdb will help you to create a database-driven, ready-to-extend, customer oriented, deployable applications.


This project aim to fill some little gaps present in most opens-source scaffolding tools. Those tool are the optimus when you use what they offer, but not very flexible for very custom needs. If you used some of thems in a business scenario, I fear you could know what I'm speaking of. 

Starting from this premise, we try to develop a flexible scaffolding tool, easily customizable, need-centric, melting up some widely diffused frameworks.
